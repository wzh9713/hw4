My first idea is about two kids stand in frount of the door. The mouse control the hand of each kid. 
players can use the mouse to click the bell next to the door. If nothing happens, switch to the next kid, 
which could be another player. There is a chance a man will break out of the door to curse the kid who just
trigger the bell.
